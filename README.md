## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned
I used semantic html and css. I didn't use flexbox or grid to create the button menu. I realized I could just create everything using simple solutions.

```css
.profile-card {
  margin: 10rem auto 0;
  text-align: center;
}

.profile-card___button {
  width: 100%;
}
```
I was able to center everything using the text-align property and setting the horizontal margin to auto.
The profile button was created by setting the width to 100%. I also liked separating the css files into its own folder to keep things neat.

### Continued development

It took me a while to figure out I need to set the width of the parent element to make the button as wide as I needed them to be. In the future I plan on sketching
out a plan better or creating pseudo code so that I don't get stuck or lost on what to do.
